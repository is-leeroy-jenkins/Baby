### ![](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/Bubba/blob/master/Resources/Assets/GitHubImages/chrome.png) CefSharp Requirements

#### The binaries directory must contain these required dependencies:

- libcef.dll (Chromium Embedded Framework Core library)
- icudtl.dat (Unicode Support data)
- chrome_elf.dll(Crash reporting library)
- snapshot_blob.bin, v8_context_snapshot.bin (V8 snapshot data)
- locales\en-US.pak, chrome_100_percent.pak, chrome_200_percent.pak, resources.pak, 
- d3dcompiler_47.dll 
- libEGL.dll 
- libGLESv2.dll

#### Whilst these are technically listed as optional, the browser is unlikely to function without these files.

- CefSharp.Core.dll, CefSharp.dll 
- CefSharp.Core.Runtime.dll
- CefSharp.BrowserSubprocess.exe 
- CefSharp.BrowserSubProcess.Core.dll

#### These are required CefSharp binaries that are the common core logic binaries of CefSharp (only 1 required).

- CefSharp.WinForms.dll
- CefSharp.Wpf.dll
- CefSharp.OffScreen.dll

#### By default `CEF` has it's own log file, `Debug.log` which is located in your executing folder. e.g. `bin`

### ![](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/Baby/blob/main/Resources/Assets/GitHubImages/signature.png)  Code Signing 

Baby uses free code signing provided by [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) and a free code signing certificate
from [SignPath Foundation](https://signpath.org/).

The binaries and installer are built on [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/is-leeroy-jenkins/networkmanager) directly from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/Baby/blob/main/appveyor.yml).
Build artifacts are automatically sent to [SignPath.io](https://signpath.io/) via webhook, where they are signed after manual approval by the maintainer.
The signed binaries are then uploaded to the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/is-leeroy-jenkins/Baby/releases) page.
